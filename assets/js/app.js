When the owners bought this old Victorian house in the Mapleton Hill neighborhood, it had additions and subtractions over the years that had taken some of the charm. It was an interesting study of how to meld the old and new in a way that respects the old house while giving the family the space they need. The original front porch had been removed, but I was able to recreate it from a Historic photo. A low ceiling addition from the 70’s was removed in order to make space for an open Living Room, a new staircase and a Primary Suite. The house now stands proud in a way that reflects the past while embracing the now.",

Nearby wood slats create an energetic shadow play that is felt throughout the day. Even the basement bath has fun with expansive ten foot tall ceilings and a living garden wall.",

By vaulting the main floor ceiling and removing a few walls, it allowed us room to construct a towering fireplace as a centerpiece to the Living Room and Kitchen. We excavated the basement down to produce ten foot ceilings that allowed the basement spaces to rival those of the main floor. The careful selection of the fireplace stone as well the lighted mineral cubbies in the bookcase design were designed to reflect the passion of the geologist homeowners.",

In addition, two charming bay windows and a rounded Palladian window in-laid with leaded glass bring in lots of light. It sits nicely on the lot and has ‘good bones’, justifying a modern day renovation for its current owners who thankfully, respect the past. </br></br> The interior restoration was reliant upon a 21st century aesthetic, the use of quality natural materials, and a casual ease of living.

        description: "The house is known to some as the Randall-Hickman House and features a unique combination of historic charm and stunning views.  Constructed in 1918 as one of the first homes in Boulder, it was originally designed by architect Arthur E. Saunders as one of the few Colorado Tudor Revivals in the Boulder area. This style of architecture combined the classic Tudor style with the practicality and simplicity of architecture common to the Colorado gold rush. The house underwent a massive rehabilitation and renewal in 2016, staying true to its unique and timeless character. </br></br>Contractor // Joel Smiley </br>Architecture // Laura Schaeffer Architecture",
