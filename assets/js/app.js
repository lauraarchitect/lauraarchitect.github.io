When the owners bought this old Victorian house in the Mapleton Hill neighborhood, it had additions and subtractions over the years that had taken some of the charm. It was an interesting study of how to meld the old and new in a way that respects the old house while giving the family the space they need. The original front porch had been removed, but I was able to recreate it from a Historic photo. A low ceiling addition from the 70’s was removed in order to make space for an open Living Room, a new staircase and a Master Suite. The house now stands proud in a way that reflects the past while embracing the now.",

The wall between the Kitchen and Patio is an operable wall that allows the homeowners to basically live outside while cooking. Nearby wood slats create an energetic shadow play that is felt throughout the day. Even the basement bath has fun with expansive ten foot tall ceilings and a living garden wall.",

By vaulting the main floor ceiling and removing a few walls, it allowed us room to construct a towering fireplace as a centerpiece to the Living Room and Kitchen. We excavated the basement down to produce ten foot ceilings that allowed the basement spaces to rival those of the main floor. The careful selection of the fireplace stone as well the lighted mineral cubbies in the bookcase design were designed to reflect the passion of the geologist homeowners.",
